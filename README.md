# Snake

Another silly game I made in high school.
This poor defenseless 100-foot-long anaconda is being harassed by clown apples.
Eat them and dodge their fireballs in order to become king of the jungle or something.


## Running

Install PyGame: `http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml`

Then: `./run.sh`


## Playing

Use the arrow keys to move.
Don't run into yourself, fireballs, or the edges of the screen.
Do run into clown apples. Yum!


## Joystick mode

This game used to work with joysticks. I don't know if it still does.
